### An FPS Booster/Unlocker For Stumble Guys
![Nouveau projet (2)](https://github.com/Jxkss/StumbleBooster/assets/115944854/0f0b1dac-3472-4c99-b21d-c968f5b67bd5)
This is an updated better working version of my other software!
            

The normal fps cap for Stumble Guys without Vsync is 480fps but ive seen it go up to 800 with my Unlocker.

I left the original file as well as the compiled version if you dont want to go through the trouble of installing everything needed!
If you want to run it normally just use the compiled .exe, if you don't you can use the installer.bat to install all the required libraries and run the .pyw!
